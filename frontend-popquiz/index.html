    <h1>The Information's Front-end Pop Quiz</h1>
    <div>
      Hi, we're glad you're interested in joining The Information's engineering team!
      This exercise is intended to check your abilities with some front-end coding basics.
      There are two tasks, and each has lots of good solutions.
    </div>
    <div>
      We think these tasks will be fairly quick to complete - if you've spent most of an hour, <i>please</i>
      stop working and tell us it's too much. Others will probably agree, and we want to know!
    </div>
    <div>
      Please don't read the instructions until you're ready to start working,
      and please tell us how much time you spent.
      Be honest about it, of course - if you tell us you did it in ten minutes, we'll hire you...
      and expect you to keep working that fast!
    </div>
    <div>
      You can do these tasks in either order.
      Feel free to check any documentation you like; after all using docs well is part of coding well.
    </div>
    <div>
      When you're ready to start, note the time, then scroll down to read the tasks! Have fun!
    </div>

    <h2>Responsive Layout Task</h2>
    <div>
      Take a look at this very basic page: <a href="cats.html">cats.html</a>
    </div>
    <div>
      We want it to look nice on small, medium, and large screens.
      So please modify cats.html so it's responsive as follows:
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
	On a wide screen, the text should be on the left, with the four photos on the right in a 2x2 square:<br>
	<img src="responsive-wide.jpg" style="width: 300px;">
      </li>
      <li>
	On medium size, the photos should instead be in a vertical strip, so the text next to it is a comfortably readable column:<br>
	<img src="responsive-medium.jpg" style="width: 300px;">
      </li>
      <li>
	On a phone-sized screen, the photos should form a 2x2 square above the text:<br>
	<img src="responsive-narrow.jpg" style="width: 300px;">
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      No need to make a separate stylesheet file; you can just define your styles within cats.html (as is already the case for H1).
    </div>
    <div>
      What do we mean by "wide" vs "medium" etc? It doesn't matter much. You can choose definitions that
      make the page look decent at all sizes.
    </div>

    <h2>Interactive Behavior Task</h2>
    <div>
      Remember, you can do this before the other task if you like.
      It's also a change to <a href="cats.html">cats.html</a>.
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
	When the user clicks a photo, call this API endpoint:
	<a href="https://api.kanye.rest">https://api.kanye.rest/</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	You'll receive a JSON object back. Set the page's H1 element to the "quote" element of the response.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      No need to make a separate javascript file; you can just put your code in a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag
      inside cats.html.
      You're welcome to use any external tools or libraries that you like. Or dislike.
    </div>

    <h2>And when you're done, or tired of this,</h2>
    <div>
      Email your final cats.html file to
      <a href="mailto:andy@theinformation.com">andy@theinformation.com</a>,
      and tell me how long you spent on it. Thank you!
