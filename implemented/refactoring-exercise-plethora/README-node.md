### Node notes
Run `mocha` to make sure your test output is correct.

Style is up to you.  Promises, better callbacks, async, etc.
But pick a style with which you're comfortable.

You're encouraged to use any modules from NPM or any other
resources you'd normally use in your work day.  This is
not a memorization test.

Prioritize what you think will make this code the most readable,
testable, and versitile.  Comments are your friend.
